A Statistical Classification has a structure which is composed of one or several Levels. 


A Level often is associated with a concept, which defines it. 


In a hierarchical Statistical Classification the Classification Items of each Level but the highest are aggregated to the nearest higher Level. 

A linear Statistical Classification has only one Level. 

*************************

A level is a constituent of a Statistical Classification.

NOTES: A level might be defined by a concept.  In a hierarchical classification [interpreted to mean there is a hierarchy of levels--?defined by logical subsumption, skos:broader, or some other relation?....], items assigned to a particular level are 'aggregated' in the parent level. [What does aggregated mean?-- isA, partOf, memberOf, kindOf?...].  

Are items in a domain members of a level (purely extensional), instances of a level (meet certain properties), subtypes of a level (meet narrower property restrictions), part of a level (partonomy)...
