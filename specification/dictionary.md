# Overview

This is **version 1.0** of the dictionary of metadata to be used
with the XAS Data Interchange (XDI) format.  Each item definition
includes:

1. The name representing the datum
1. The meaning of the datum
1. Thw units of the datum
1. The format for representing its value

Words used to signify the requirements in the specification **shall**
follow the practice of
[RFC 2119](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt).

A use of this dictionary is not compliant if it fails to satisfy one
or more of the **must** or **required** level requirements presented
herein.



## The meaning of metadata

The purpose of this dictionary is to identify a set of metadata to be
encoded in the specification of the XDI format and to assign names to
each meaningful concept.  This effort must take a broad view,
capturing metadata concepts as broadly as they are used in the
community.  This effort must also be open ended in that there must be
a mechanism for providing new forms of metadata not considered up
front.  This effort is intended to serve as the XAS metadata
dictionary for other data format types, for instance a database format
for libraries of XAS spectra or a hierarchical format for
multi-spectral datasets.

## The XDI syntax

This dictionary has been developed along with the
[XDI specification](spec.md).  All examples given in this dictionary
use all recommendations of the XDI syntax.  The metadata name consists
of the capitalized namespace, followed by a dot, followed by a tag.
Here is an example: `Element.symbol`.  When appearing in an XDI file
to convey a metadata value, the line begins with a comment token and
end with an end-of-line token.  A colon is the delimiting token
between the metadata name and its value.  Here is an example:

       # Element.symbol: Cu


## The format of the value

Some of the tags in this dictionary have formatted values as part of
their definitions.

* _string_: A string is specifically an ASCII string representable by
  characters in the the lower 128 of the ASCII set.  This **must** the
  English-language representation of the value.  For example, the
  string representing `Facility.name` for the Thai synchrotron
  **must** be `SLRI` rather than a sequence of characters in the Thai
  script.

* _free-format string_: This is a string which can contain any
  character (save end-of-line characters) in any encoding system.  A
  free-format string need not be ASCII and need not be English.
  Because applications using XDI may not be capable of handling some
  encoding systems, it is **recommended** that free-format strings be
  ASCII.

* _string + units_: This is a string as defined above, followed by
  white space, followed by a string denoting the units of the previous
  string.  As an example, a value for `Column.1` might be `energy eV`,
  which identifies the contents of the first column in the data table
  as containing energy values expressed in electron volt units.  The
  selection of possible units for a tag is given in the definition of
  the tag.

* _float_: A float is a string which is interpretable as a
  floating-point number in the C programming language.  An integer is
  permissable.  Values of `NaN`, `sNAN`, `qNAN`, `inf`, `+inf`, and
  `-inf` are not allowed in XDI.  That is, a float in XDI **must** be
  a finite number.  See
  [IEEE 754-2008](http://grouper.ieee.org/groups/754/).

* _float + units_: This is a float as defined above, followed by white
  space, followed by a string identifying the units of the number.
  For example, a value for `Sample.temperature`, which identifies the
  temperature at which an XAS measurement is made, might be `500 K`,
  identifying the temperature of the measurements in Kelvin
  temperature units.  The selection of possible units for a tag is
  given in the definition of the tag.

* _chemical formulas_: `Sample.stoichiometry` is intended to represent
  the elemental composition of the sample.  To allow interpretation of
  chemical formulas by computer, this field and extension fields which
  represent chemical information **must** use the
  [IUCr definition of a chemical formula](http://www.iucr.org/__data/iucr/cifdic_html/1/cif_core.dic/Cchemical_formula.html).

* _time_: Because of the wide variability of cultural standards in the
  representation of time, XDI defines a strict standard for time
  stamps in XDI files.  `Scan.start_time`, `Scan.end_time`, and any
  extension fields dealing in time **must** use the
  [ISO 8601 specification for combined dates and times](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Combined_date_and_time_representations)

* _element symbols_: `Element.symbol`, `Element.reference`, and any
  extension fields identifying specific elements **must** use one of
  the recognized 1, 2, or 3 letter symbols given in
  [Defined items in the Element namespace](#defined-items-in-the-element-namespace)

* _edge symbols_: `Element.edge`, `Element.ref_edge`, and any
  extension fields identifying specific absorption edges **must** use
  one of the recognized 1 or 2 letter symbols given in
  [Defined items in the Element namespace](#defined-items-in-the-element-namespace).
  Note that the subscript is represented as an Arabic numeral and not
  as a Roman numeral.


Some additional comments:

* Locale is **not** respected when interpreting floating point numbers.
  The decimal mark **must** be a dot (`.`, ASCII 46).  The decimal mark
  **must not** be a comma (`,`, ASCII 44).

* A tag which is in a defined family but which is not defined in this
  dictionary **must** be interpreted as have a free-format string as its
  value.

* A tag which is present in an XDI file but which has no value or only
  white space as its value (i.e.\ the colon is followed by zero or more
  spaces tokens then by an end-of-line token) **must** be interpreted as
  a zero-length string or as the value 0, as appropriate to the value
  type.

* Strings identifying facilities and beamlines **must** use whatever
  convention is in use at the beamline.  In the case where a beamline
  is known both by a designation and a name (for example, beamline
  13ID at the Advanced Photon Source is also known by its name,
  "GSECARS"), the designation is **recommended**.



# The dictionary

## Name spaces

The purpose of namespaces is to provide sensible, widely understood,
semantic groupings of defined metadata tags.  All tags associated with
conveying information about sample preparation and the measurement
environment of the sample belong in the _Sample_ namespace, all tags
associated with the configuration of the beamline optics belong in the
_Beamline_ namespace, and so on.

Namespaces are strings composed of a subset of the ASCII character
set.  The first character **must** be a letter.  The remaining
characters **must** be letters, numbers, underscores, or dashes.
Letters are ASCII 65 through 90 (`A-Z`) and ASCII 97-122 (`a-z`).
Numbers are ASCII 48-57 (`0-9`).  Underscore (`_`) is ASCII 95 and
dash (`-`) is ASCII 45.  The namespace **must** be interpreted as case
insentitive.

Here is a list of all defined semantic groupings:

1. `Facility`: Tags related to the synchrotron or other facility at which the measurement was made
1. `Beamline`: Tags related to the structure of the beamline and its photon delivery system
1. `Mono`:     Tags related to the monochromator
1. `Detector`: Tags related to the details of the photon detection system
1. `Sample`:   Tags related to the details of sample preparation and measurement
1. `Scan`:     Tags related to the parameters of the scan
1. `Element`:  Tags related to the absorbing atom
1. `Column`:   Tags used for identifying the data columns and their units

Below, specific members of these namespaces are defined.  The
definitons are not exclusive.  Other metadata can be placed in these
namespaces as needed.  Of course, undefined metadata are unlikely to
be interpreted correctly by applications using this dictionary.
Metadata added to a defined namespace **must not** use a defined
tag.  The defined namespaces and tags **shall** be interpreted
without sensitivity to case.

When defined metadata are present, the units and formatting specified
below **must** be observed.


## Tags

Tags are the words used to denote a specific entry in a namespace.

Tags are strings composed of a subset of the ASCII character set.  All
characters **must** be letters (ASCII 65 through 90, `A-Z` and ASCII
97-122, `a-z`), numbers (ASCII 48-57, `0-9`), underscore (ASCII 95,
`_`), or dash (ASCII 45, `-`).

The tag **must** be interpreted as case insentitive.

## Required metadata

Three items are essential to the interchange and successful
interpretation of XAS data. These are **required** in all files using
the [XDI specification](spec.md).

 * `Element.symbol`: The element of the absorbing atom. The periodic
   table is replete with examples of atoms that have absorption edges
   with very similar edge energies.  For example, the tabulated values
   of the Cr K edge and the Ba L1 edge are both 5989 eV.  Without
   identification of the species of the absorbing atom and of the
   absorption edge measured, some data cannot cannot be unambiguously
   identified.

 * `Element.edge`: The absorption edge measured.  See above.

 * `Mono.d_spacing`: The d-spacing of the monochromator.  This is
   **required** when the abscissa is expressed in angle or encoder steps.
   It is required to convert that abscissa into energy.  Also a
   correction to the energy axis of measured data, which may be
   required in the case of a miscalibration due to inaccuracies in the
   translation from angular position of the monochromator to energy,
   would need the d-spacing.

Most other metadata definitions that follow are **optional** for use
with XDI.  Some are **recommended** for use with all XDI files.  The
**recommended** metadata convey information that is of substantive
value to the interpretation of the data.

The Sample namespace is rather open-ended.  It is probably impossible
to anticipate all the kinds of sample-related metadata that may be
useful to attach to data.  That said, it would be useful to suggest
tags for a number of common kinds of extrinsic parameters.

Here are some other possible tags denoting extrinsic parameters of the
experiment along the line of `Sample.temperature`.  These may be added
as defined fields in future versions of the XDI specification.

* `Sample.pressure`
* `Sample.ph`
* `Sample.eh`
* `Sample.volume`
* `Sample.porosity`
* `Sample.density`
* `Sample.concentration`
* `Sample.resistivity`
* `Sample.viscosity`
* `Sample.electric_field`
* `Sample.magnetic_field`
* `Sample.magnetic_moment`
* `Sample.crystal_structure`
* `Sample.opacity`
* `Sample.electrochemical_potential`

Almost all of these examples **should** take a float+units as values.



## Defined items in the Scan namespace


* **Namespace:** `Scan` -- **Tag:** `start_time`
     * _Description_: The beginning time of the scan. This is **recommended** for use with XDI.
     * _Units_: time
     * _Format_: [ISO 8601 specification for combined dates and times](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Combined_date_and_time_representations)

* **Namespace:** `Scan` -- **Tag:** `end_time`
     * _Description_: The beginning time of the scan.
     * _Units_: time
     * _Format_: [ISO 8601 specification for combined dates and times](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Combined_date_and_time_representations)

* **Namespace:** `Scan` -- **Tag:** `edge_energy`
     * _Description_: The absorption edge as used in the data acquisition software.
     * _Units_: eV (**recommended**), keV, inverse &Aring;
     * _Format_: float + units

This is the appropriate namespace for any parameters associated with
scan parameters, such as integration times, monochromator speed, scan
boundaries, or step sizes.

An example of a combined date and time representation is
`2007-04-05T14:30`, which means 2:30 in the afternoon on the day of
April 5th in the year 2007.



## Defined items in the Element namespace

* **Namespace:** `Element` -- **Tag:** `symbol`
     * _Description_: The measured absorption edge.  This is a

               As Se Br Kr Rb Sr Y  Zr Nb Mo Tc Ru Rh Pd Ag Cd
               In Sn Sb Te I  Xe Cs Ba La Ce Pr Nd Pm Sm Eu Gd
               Tb Dy Ho Er Tm Yb Lu Hf Ta W  Re Os Ir Pt Au Hg
               Tl Pb Bi Po At Rn Fr Ra Ac Th Pa U  Np Pu Am Cm
               Bk Cf Es Fm Md No Lr Rf Db Sg Bh Hs Mt Ds Rg Cn
               Uut Fl Uup Lv Uus Uuo

     See [Wikipedia's list of element symbols](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbol_%28chemical_element%29).

* **Namespace:** `Element` -- **Tag:** `edge`
     * _Description_: The measured absorption edge.  This is a
       **required** parameter for use with XDI.
     * _Units_: none
     * _Format_: one of these 28 1 or 2 character strings (not case sensitive):
  
               K L L1 L2 L3  M M1 M2 M3 M4 M5 N N1 N2 N3 N4 N5 N6 N7 O O1 O2 O3 O4 O5 O6 O7

       See table 10.10 at
       [IUPAC notation for X-ray absorption edges](http://old.iupac.org/publications/analytical_compendium/Cha10sec348.pdf)
       for further explanation.  The use of the generic edges _L_, _M_,
       _N_, and _O_ is **not recommended**, but **may** be used for spectra
       spanning multiple edges.


* **Namespace:** `Element` -- **Tag:** `reference`
     * _Description_: The absorption edge of the reference spectrum.  This is a
       **recommended** parameter for use in an XDI file containing a
       reference spectrum.
     * _Units_: none
     * _Format_: same as `Element.symbol`

* **Namespace:** `Element` -- **Tag:** `ref_edge`
     * _Description_: The measured edge of the reference spectrum.  This
       is a **recommended** parameter for use in an XDI file containing a
       reference spectrum.
     * _Units_: none
     * _Format_: same as `Element.edge`





## Defined items in the Column namespace

Items in the Column namespace describe single columns of the data
table.  The first column **must** be the energy.

All tags in the `Column` namespace **must** be integers.

* **Namespace:** `Column` -- **Tag:** `1`
     * _Description_: A description of the abscissa array for the measured
       data.  This is **recommended** for use in an XDI file.
     * _Units_: eV (**recommended**), keV, pixel, angle in degrees, angle in radians, steps
     * _Format_: word + units

* **Namespace:** `Column` -- **Tag:** `N`
     * _Description_: A description of the Nth column (where `N` is an
       integer) of the measured data.  This is **recommended** for use
       in an XDI file.
     * _Units_: as needed
     * _Format_: word (+ units)


The following labels are defined for common array types.  `Column.N`
items **must** use these labels when appropriate.  The array label
line at the beginning of the data section of the XDI file also
**must** use these labels when those columns are present.


| Column label |   Meaning                           | choice of units (if required) |

| `r`          |   radial distance                   |                               |
| `chir_mag`   |   magnitude of FT[chi(k)]           |                               |
| `chir_pha`   |   phase of FT[chi(k)]               |                               |
| `chir_re`    |   real part of FT[chi(k)]           |                               |
| `chir_im`    |   imaginary part of FT[chi(k)]      |                               |


A column containing some other measurement **must** be identified with
units when appropriate.  For example, a column counting time since the
`Scan.start_time` timestamp might be labeled as

        # Column.N: elapsed_time seconds

while a column containing an ongoing measure of temperature as a
voltage on a themocouple might be labeled as

        # Column.N: thermocouple millivolts



## Extension fields

Metadata tags carry syntax and may carry semantics.  That is, it is
possible to have syntactically correct tags that have no definition.
Such tags could carry information considered useful by the user or the
author of software that, at some point, touches the data.

Such a tag could be an extension within an existing namespace.  This
has already been discussed in the context of the `Sample` and `Scan`
namespaces.

Such a tag could also be part of a new namespace.  One application of
a new namespace would be to tie a group of metadata tags to a
particular application.  For example, the data processing program
Athena might attach tags associated with the parameters for
normalizing the data.  That might look something like this:

       # Athena.pre1: -150
       # Athena.pre2: -30
       # Athena.nor1: 150
       # Athena.nor2: 800

These define the boundaries of the pre- and post-edge lines used to
determine the edge step of the mu(E) spectrum.

The use of such extension tags is encouraged for authors of controls,
data acquisition, data analysis, and data archiving software.

If an extension tag is not understood due its lack of defined
semantics, the **recommended** behavior for software touching
the data is to silently preserve the metadata.
