# Introduction


This document describes the XAS Data Interchange Format (XDI),
version 1.0, a simple file format for a single X-ray
Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS) measurement.

This document is an effort of an *ad hoc* working group
reporting to the
[International X-ray Absorption Society (IXAS)](http://www.ixasportal.net/)
and the
[XAFS Commission of International Union of Crystallography (IUCr-XC)](http://www.iucr.org/resources/commissions/xafs).
The charge of this working group is to propose standards for the
storage and dissemination of XAS and related data.

## Purpose

We are define this format to accomplish the following goals:

 * Establish a common language for transferring data between XAS
   beamlines, XAS experimenters, data analysis packages, web
   applications, and anything else that needs to process XAS data.

 * Increase the relevance and longevity of experimental data by
   reducing the amount of *data archeology* future
   interpretations of that data will require. ([The Farrel
   Lytle ``database''](http://ixs.csrri.iit.edu/database/data/index.html)
   is a particularly trenchant example of data archeology.)

 * Enhance the user experience by promoting interoperability among
   data acquisition systems, data analysis packages, and other
   applications.

 * Provide a mechanism for extracting and preserving a single
   XAS-like data set from a related experiment (for example, a DAFS or
   inelastic scattering measurement) or from a complex data structure
   (for example, a database or a hierarchical data file used to store a
   multi-spectral data set).
   
 * Provide a representation of an XAS spectrum suitable for
   deposition with a journal or in a database.

In short, we need to share data across continents, decades, and
analysis toolkits.

This format is intended to encode a single XAS spectrum in a data file
with metadata.  It is not intended to encode relationships between
many XAS measurements or between an XAS measurement and other parts of
a multi-spectral experiment.  (Those are worthwhile topics, just not
the purpose of XDI.)

In order to fulfill these goals, XDI files provide a flexible,
consistent representation of information common to all XAS
experiments.  The format of XDI is simpler than a format based on XML,
HDF, or a database; it yields self-documenting files; and it is easy
for both humans and computers to read.  The structure of XDI is
inspired by that of Internet electronic mail (See
[RFC822: Standard for ARPA Internet Text Messages](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc822/)),
a plain-text data format which has proven to be robust, extensible,
and enduring.  XDI can be read as is by many existing programs for XAS
and other data analysis and by many scientifc plotting programs.

Due to these advantages, and because of our intention to develop free
software tools and libraries that support XDI, we hope that this
file format described in this specification will see wide adoption in
the XAS community.

## Scope

We do not intend this specification to dictate the file formats used
by data acquisition systems during XAS experiments, although XDI may
be suitable for that purpose.  Any attempt to do so would be
unreasonable due to the number of different data acquisition systems
currently deployed at synchrotrons around the world, the variety of
experiments performed at these installations, and the continuing
development of new experimental techniques.

*This specification addresses the representation of a single scan of
 XAS data after an experiment has been completed.*

A beamline which adopts this specification shall either use this
format as its native file format or shall provide their users with
tools that convert between their native file formats and XDI.  In
short, when that beamline sends a user home with XAS data that is
ready to be analyzed, that XAS data will be stored in this format.  We
intend to encourage this practice by developing tools for reading,
editing, writing, and validating XDI files.  Beamlines may choose to
modify their data acquisition systems to write data using this format
in situations where that would be appropriate.  We plan to assist in
this effort by developing libraries for popular programming languages
which can read, manipulate, and write XDI files.

With their experimental data stored in XDI files, users may choose
data analysis packages which are capable of reading this format.  It
is our hope that, as this specification gains wider adoption, users
will ultimately be freed from the responsibility of understanding
quirky, beamline-specific file formats.  With this aim in mind, we
shall assist software developers in supporting XDI files.




# Content of the XAS Data Interchange File

XDI files contain two sections, a header with information about one
scan of an XAS experiment followed by the data collected during that
scan. The header section consists of versioning information, a series
of fields with information about the scan, an area for users to store
comments about the experiment, and a sequence of labels for the
columns of data. The data section contains these columns, with each
row corresponding to one point of the scan.

The header has been designed to contain arbitrary metadata describing
the contents of the file. This metadata is organized in a way that is
easily readable by both humans and computers. These fields, described
below, contain information about XAS experiments which is useful for
both users and applications.  Some headers are defined, see
[Defined namespaces](#defined-namespaces).

# Definition of the XAS Data Interchange Format

This section of the XDI specification formally describes the
structure of XDI files.

## Requirements

The key words "**must**", "**must not**", "**required**",
"**should**", "**should not**", "**recommended**", "**may**", and
"**optional**" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
RFC 2119.  See
[Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt).

An XDI implementation is *not compliant* if it fails to satisfy one or
more of the **must** or **required** level requirements presented in
this specification.


## Notational Conventions

Several XDI *tokens* are used throughout the definition of the XDI
file.

 * The white-space token is a space (ASCII 32) or a tab (ASCII 9)
 * The comment token is a hash (`#`, ASCII 35)
 * The end-of-line token can be carriage return (ASCII 13,
   `CR`, Mac-style), newline (ASCII 10, `LF`,
   Unix-style), or a sequence of one carriage return + one newline
   (Windows-style)
 * The namespace-separator token is a dot (`.`, ASCII 46)
 * The metadata-end token is a colon (`:`, ASCII 58)
 * The field-end token consists of three or more foreward slash
   characters (`/`, ASCII 47)
 * The header-end token consists of three or more dash characters
   (`-`, ASCII 45)

## Text Encoding

The header and data sections of an XDI file are comprised of
structured US-ASCII (see
[ASCII table](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII) text.  Header field
values that are "free-form" or "text" **may** contain UTF-8 encoded
Unicode text, although Unicode support in applications that use XDI
files **should not** be assumed, particularly those written in
languages with weak or non-existent Unicode suport (e.g. Fortran).
Unicode support in applications that use XDI files is **optional**,
but **recommended**.  The US-ASCII coded character set is defined
formally by ANSI X3.4-186 (see
[section 4.1.2 of Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) Part Two: Media Types](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2046)).
The Universal Character Set (Unicode) is defined by ISO/IEC 10646. The
UTF-8 translation format is defined by
[IETF RFC 3629](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3629).


## Structure of the Header Section


The header section of an XDI file appears at the beginning of the file
and is comprised of structured text.

Header line rules:

 * Every line of the header **must** begin with a comment
   token and must end with an end-of-line token
 * Header lines may be of any length, but users of XDI **should**
   remember that XAS software may be implemented in a programming
   language without dynamic memory allocation (e.g. Fortran) and so
   should restrict lines to 2048 characters.


Header lines are subdivided into four sections --- versioning
information, header fields, user comments, and column labels --- with
two separators, one of which is always **required**.  These sections
**must** occur in the following sequence:

 1. The **required** first line of the file is the version
    line, described in [Version information](#version-information).
 1. This is followed by header lines, which can be defined headers or
    extension headers. These two header types are explained in
    [Header fields](#header-fields).  Some headers are **required**,
    as explained in [Required elements](#required-elements).  Others
    are **recommended**.
 1. The header lines are separated from the user comments by the
    field-end line.  If the comment section is present, this separator
    line **must** also be present. If the comment section is
    absent, the header lines **may** terminate with the
    end-of-header line. The field-end line is defined at the end of this
    section.
 1. The **optional** comment section is for user-supplied,
    free-format text.  Each line begins with a comment token and ends
    with an end-of-line.
 1. The comment section ends with the **required** header-end
    line.  The header-end line is defined at the end of this section.
 1. The last line before the data is a line of **optional**
    column labels which identify the columns of data.  If present, there
    **must** be as many labels as there are columns. The label line
    begins with a comment character and ends with an end-of-line. See
    [Column labels](#column-labels).


The field-end and header-end separator lines serve specific, syntactic
purposes in the XDI grammar. For the human reader, the line of dashes
is a visual cue denoting the end of the headers and beginning of the
data. The field-end line serves to separate and distinguish field
lines from freely-formatted user comments, which may resemble a header
fields or other grammatical constructs. Similarly, the header-end line
serves to distinguish column labels from user comments, which are
otherwise grammatically identical elements of the data file.


#### Definitions of separator lines

 * **Field-end line:** comment token + field-end token + end-of-line token

        # /////////////

 * **Header-end line:** comment token + header-end token + end-of-line token

        # -------------


### Version Information

The first line of the XDI header contains the XDI version to which the
file conforms.  XDI represents versions of the file format with a
`<version>.<subversion>.<release>` numbering scheme. The
`<subversion>` number is incremented when changes are made to the
format that do not affect compatibility with previous versions, as
when new defined header fields are added to the dictionary.  (A parser
compliant with an earlier minor version would treat the newly defined
header as an extension field.  Propagated to an output file as an
extension field, this field would then be interpreted correctly by a
more recent parser.)  The `<version>` number is incremented when major
changes are made to the format, as when the definition of the contents
of a defined header field is altered.  The `<release>` is incremented
when the library or its documentation is altered without altering the
specification in any way.  Use of the `<release>` number in XDI files
is **optional**.

A series of **optional** entries denoting further versioning
information, separated by white space, **may** follow the XDI version.
There **may** be any number of extra versioning strings. These version
entries allow programs to annotate the file as it proceeds through the
collection and analysis process.  Such annotation is **optional**
although version information **should** be included in this sequence
by software that create XDI files containing extension fields (see
[Extension headers](#extension-headers)).
When an application adds versioning information to this line, it
**should** be appended to the end of the line.  The order of the
optional version entries is undefined but **should** be preserved by
application reading the file in order to accurately represent the time
sequence in which applications have manipulated the file.

The slash character (`/`, ASCII 47) is used to separate `XDI` or the
application name from its version number.

Note that the XDI version, subversion, and release numbers
**must** be treated as integers that **may** contain more
than a single digit. `XDI/1.12` is a higher (more recent) version than
`XDI/1.2`.

This specification does not impose a restriction on how applications
identify and version themselves.  However, a single application
**must** identify and version itself using a single text sequence
without white space. Some acceptable examples follow.  The first
example shows an application which uses the same format as the XDI
version rule, which is the **recommended** format for application
versioning.  The second shows names of the data acquisition and data
processing programs, each is specified by name but without the
**recommended** version numbers.


         # XDI/1.0 Datacollectatron/7.75

         # XDI/1.0 XDAC Athena

The name of the the additional applications **must** be used for
any extension headers associated with that application (see
[Extension headers](#extension-headers)).

The following is an example of a data acquisition program with an odd
name and which uses non-standard versioning.

         # XDI/1.0 XAS!Collect-3000

There are two problems with this.  The versioning information will not
be recognized as such becasue it does not use the slash character.
Also the requirement that the application name be used as the family
name of any extension headers added by the program will result in a
non-compliant family name.  The exclamation point is not an allowed
character for family names.


### Header Fields

Immediately following the version line is the header fields section.
These fields are arranged in a manner similar to the header of an
Internet electronic mail message, although XDI fields **must not**
span multiple lines.  Each field consists of a case-insensitive name,
a separating colon, and an associated value.  The structure of the
name is presented in [XDI fields](#xdi-fields).  When multiple
occurrences of the same field are present the value of the last
occurrence **must** be used as the value for the field.

Except in the case of a defined header whose value has a structure
defined in the dictionary, values are assumed to be free-form text, as
explained in [Text encoding](#text-encoding).  The defined fields are
explained in [Defined namespaces](#defined-namespaces).

When a user comments section is present, the header fields section
must end with a field-end line.  When a comments section is absent,
the header fields section **must** end with a field-end line.  See
[Structure of the Header Section](#structure-of-the-header-section)
for the definitions of the separator lines.

### User Comments

Following the dividing line at the end of the header fields section
is the area of the header that contains user comments.  This area is
reserved for comments supplied by the experimenter and **must not** be
used by software as a place to store other information.  Refer to
[Extension headers](#extension-headers)
for information about using extension fields for this purpose.

This section **may** contain zero lines of commentary or empty
lines containing no text other than the **required** comment
token.  An empty line **must** be treated as a zero-length
comment line. This section **must** end with a header-end
separator line.

When extracting the comment section from an XDI file, software
**may** remove no more than one leading space and any trailing
white space from each comment line but **must not** further alter
the line's contents, all interior white space **must** be preserved.

Applications **must** preserve all user comments, including empty
lines and interior white space, when exporting the XDI data as an
XDI file.


### Column Labels

The final line of the XDI header contains the labels for each
column of data in the data section of the file, separated by
white space.  There **must** be one label present for each column
of data present in the data section.

The number of column labels **must** equal the number of columns
of data in the data section.

Note that each column label **must** be a word, white space
**must** separate the labels, and labels **must not**
contain white space. For specific column labels which, in natural
language, would consist of two or more words, the use of
[CamelCase](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case),
underscores, or some other way of substituting for white space is
**required**.

The column labels in the column label line **must** match the
values of the headers in the `Column` namespace.  See
[The column namespace](#the-column-namespace).

Several common array labels are defined in the
[Dictionary of Metadata](https://github.com/XraySpectroscopy/XAS-Data-Interchange/blob/master/specification/dictionary.md)
and **must** be used when those arrays are present in a file.

## Data Section

The data section of the file contains white-space-delimited columns of
integers or floating-point numbers.  The definitions of text
representation of numbers in the C programming language are used by
XDI.  In general, this means that XDI numbers are integers and base-10
numbers as defined by IEEE 754-1985 or
[IEEE 754-2008](http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/IEEESTD.2008.4610935).

Locale is **not** respected when interpreting floating point numbers.
The decimal mark **must** be a dot (`.`, ASCII 46).  The decimal mark
**must not** be a comma (`,`, ASCII 44).

Lines in the data section **must not** begin with comment tokens.
Lines in the data section **may** begin with white space.  Leading and
trailing white space on a line in the data section **must** be
ignored.

The first (left-most) column of data **must** contain the abscissa
(energy or angle) array.

Blank lines in this section **must** be discarded.  The number of
columns **must** be the same for all lines that contain data.  All
columns, including columns containing a measurement of time, **must**
be represented as inegers or as floating point numbers.

It is **recommended** that measurements of time be represented as a
numerical offset relative to the value of the `Scan.start_time`
header.


# XDI Fields

When present, header fields **must** comply with the associated
parsing rules.  All fields which fail to do so **must** be
ignored by an application.

XDI fields use a simple namespace concept as their structure.  The
name of the field **must** be composed of two words.  The first word
in the name **must** start with a letter and **must not** start with a
number, underscore, or dash.  The second word **must** consist of
letters, numbers, underscore, or dash.  Letters are ASCII 65 through
90 (`A-Z`) and ASCII 97-122 (`a-z`).  Numbers are ASCII 48-57 (`0-9`).
Underscore (`_`) is ASCII 95 and dash (`-`) is ASCII 45.

The two words in the name **must** be separated by the dot
character (`.`, ASCII 46). The name **must** end with a
colon (`:`, ASCII 58), which is the character which delimits
the field name from its value.  The colon **may** be followed by
white space, then **must** be followed by the value of the field.
A missing value **must** be interpreted as an empty string.

Here are some examples which demonstrate both the format of the XDI
field and the *namespace* concept:

        # Beamline.name: APS 20BM
        # Beamline.source: bend magnet
        # Column.1: energy eV
        # Column.3: i0

The namespaces are used to group related fields.  In the example
above, two namespaces are shown.  The `Beamline` namespace
conveys characteristics of the beamline at which the data were
measured, while the `Column` namespace explains how to
interpret the columns in the data section.

There are two kinds of namespaces. Defined namespaces (see
[Defined namespaces](#defined-namespaces)) are defined in the
[Dictionary of Metadata](https://github.com/XraySpectroscopy/XAS-Data-Interchange/blob/master/specification/dictionary.md).
Extension namespaces (see [Extension headers](#extension-headers)) may be
added by application developers to insert new metadata into the data file.

Header fields are case insentitive. As an example, the following lines
**must** be interpreted identically:

        # Beamline.name: APS 20BM
		# beamline.name: APS 20BM
		# BEAMLINE.NAME: APS 20BM
		# bEAmlInE.naME: APS 20BM

Capitalization (like the first of these examples) of the namespace is
**recommended**.


## Defined namespaces

See the
[Dictionary of Metadata](https://github.com/XraySpectroscopy/XAS-Data-Interchange/blob/master/specification/dictionary.md)
for the current list of defined namespaces and defined metadata.

Three defined fields are **required** in a valid XDI file:

 1. `Element.symbol`: The symbol of the absorber element
 1. `Element.edge`: The measured absorption edge
 1. `Mono.d_spacing`: The d-spacing of the monochromator crystal.
    When the energy axis is conveyed as monochromator angle or encoder
    step count, this is required to translate into energy units.  When
    the energy axis is conveyed in energy units, this enables
    correction of the energy axis for a miscalibration due to
    inaccuracies in the translation from angular position of the
    monochromator to energy.

All other fields are **optional**, although some are **recommended**
and constitute best practice, as explained in the
[Dictionary of Metadata](https://github.com/XraySpectroscopy/XAS-Data-Interchange/blob/master/specification/dictionary.md).

A header in a defined namespace **should not** appear more than once
in a file.  When multiple occurrences of the same field are present,
the value of the last occurrence **must** be used as the value for the
field.


## The Column namespace

The Column namespace is the mechanism by which XDI files provide
directions about how to extract useful information from the columns in
the data section of the file.

 1. All fields in this namespace **must** be of the form
    `Column.N`, where `N` represents an integer.  The
    integer is used to identify a particular column in the data
    file.  These integers begin at 1 and count from the left-most column
    in the data section.  The value of a Column field is used to indicate
    the contents of that column.
 1. There are several defined column labels.  These are words that
    **must** be used to describe a column when that column is
    present in the data file and identified among the header fields.
    The list of defined column labels is given in the
    [Dictionary of Metadata](https://github.com/XraySpectroscopy/XAS-Data-Interchange/blob/master/specification/dictionary.md).
 1. The abscissa of the data **must** be in the first
    (left-most) column and **must** be identified by the
    `Column.1` header.
 1. Data **may** be stored using any reasonable units for the
    abscissa, but that choice of units must be identified in the value
    of the `Column.1` header.  Allowed abscissa choices include
    energy (in units of eV or keV), pixel (appropriate for dispersive
    detection of XAS), or angle (in units of degrees, radians, or motor
    steps).  eV units are **recommended**.  If units of motor steps
    are chosen, then adequate information **must** be provided via
    headers in the `Mono` namespace to translate the abscissa
    into energy units.
 1. The header identifying the abscissa **must** provide two
    values: the column label for the abscissa and the corresponding
    units. Here is an example:

         # Column.1: energy eV

    All other headers in the Column namespace **must** provide one
    value -- the column label -- and **should** provide units, if
    appropriate.


A list of column labels and their meanings along with unit definitions
for the abscissa are defined in the
[Dictionary of Metadata](https://github.com/XraySpectroscopy/XAS-Data-Interchange/blob/master/specification/dictionary.md).
Any such array included in an XDI file must use those label
definitions.  Along with column labels defining the abscissa and
various detectors, labels for representing EXAFS data in various
stages of data processing (mu(E), normalized mu(E), chi(k), the
Fourier transform of chi(k), or the Fourier filter of chi(k)) are
provided.

## Extension headers

Extension fields are fields present in the header of an XDI file that
are not defined in the XDI specification.  Such fields **must** be
structured by the same syntax as a defined field.  The values of
extension fields **must** be interpreted as free-form text.  Any field
not defined from a defined namespace (see
[Defined namespaces](#defined-namespaces)) **must** be considered an
extension field.

Data acquisition systems and data analysis packages may embed
additional information in an XDI file by adding extension fields to
the header.  Extension fields created by applications **should** begin
with a form of the application name used in the version line, followed
by a separator dot and an additional word.  In the sample XDI file in
[Example XDI file](#example-xdi-file), an example of an extension
field is `GSE.EXTRA` and takes a value of `config 1`.  Here `GSE`
denotes the data acquisition software and `EXTRA` denotes a parameter
relevant to that software.

Extension field namespaces and tags **should not** collide with the
defined namespaces and tags.  That is, applications which use
extension namepaces or which define new tags in defined namespaces
should choose words not already used in the
[Dictionary of Metadata](https://github.com/XraySpectroscopy/XAS-Data-Interchange/blob/master/specification/dictionary.md).

Applications that read XDI files **may** attempt to parse the values
of extension fields to extract the additional information about the
scan.  They **should** propagate these fields into output files they
create, and **must** propagate any associated version information (see
[Version information](#version-information)) if they do so.

Multiple occurrences of the same field are discouraged.  When present,
the value of the last occurrence (reading linearly from the beginning
of the file) **must** be preserved.


## Required elements

The following is a summary of the required elements of an XDI file:

 1. The first line of the file **must** contain version
    information. See [Version information](#version-information).
 1. The column containing the abscissa of the data and the units of
    the abscissa **must** be identified by a header field in the
    `Column` namespace.  For example, if the first column of the
    data file contains energy in eV units, the following header field
    **must** appear in the file:

        # Column.1: energy eV

 1. The column containing the abscissa of the data **must** be
    the first (left-most) column in the data section.
 1. The `Mono.d_spacing` header field **must** be
    specified if the abscissa is conveyed as monochromator angle.
 1. The `Element.symbol` and `Element.edge` headers
    are **required** in order to definatively identify the XAS
    measurement.
 1. If user comments (see [User comments](#user-comments)) are
    present in the header, the field-end line **must** be
    present to separate headers from user comments.
 1. The header-end separate line **must** be present.
 1. A data section **must** be present and each line of data
    **must** contain the same number of data fields and each field
    **must** be interpretable as an integer or a floating point
    number.

All other content is **optional**.  When present, certain content
**must** meet further requirements as explained in the
[Dictionary of Metadata](https://github.com/XraySpectroscopy/XAS-Data-Interchange/blob/master/specification/dictionary.md).
