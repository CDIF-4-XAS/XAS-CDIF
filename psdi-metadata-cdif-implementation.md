# Implementation of CDIF in PSDI metadata
This document outlines how WorldFAIR's [Cross-Domain Interoperability Framework (CDIF)](https://worldfair-project.eu/cross-domain-interoperability-framework/) has been implemented in the first version of outputs from the [Physical Sciences Data Infrastructure (PSDI)](https://www.psdi.ac.uk/).

## Introduction
PSDI is an integrated data infrastructure for empowering UK physical sciences research data and streamlining its processes. It is a project funded by the [Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)](https://www.ukri.org/councils/epsrc/) and developed by the [Sciences and Technology Facilities Council (STFC)](https://www.ukri.org/councils/stfc/) and the [University of Southampton](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/). The first version of its outputs were released in spring 2025. 

CDIF outlines detailed practical advice about how to set up the metadata for a cross-domain repository, the first version of which was published at:
- [WorldFAIR (D2.3) Cross-Domain Interoperability Framework (CDIF) (Report Synthesising Recommendations for Disciplines and Cross-Disciplinary Research Areas)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11236871) as a pdf report (which we will refer to in this document as "CDIF v1 report pdf")
- [CDIF handbook](https://cross-domain-interoperability-framework.github.io/cdifbook/introduction.html)

The release of CDIF was at a very timely point of PSDI development, and it has been a tremendously useful source of information and expertise - wherever possible PSDI are following CDIF's recommendations. 

This document outlines the PSDI metadata implementation in comparison with the recommendations of CDIF (following the order of the [CDIF handbook*](https://cross-domain-interoperability-framework.github.io/cdifbook/introduction.html)) - marking each recommended action with the following status: 
* __done__ (first version available for review and future development - this does not imply this is all completed and will not be developed further)
* __in progress__ (behind-the-scenes work has started, but is not public yet)
* __future development__ (not started yet, but is on the list)
* __not planned__ (not relevant to PSDI)

Some sections in the CDIF handbook are for background information, rather than actionable recommendations - these are omitted from comment here. 

This document was originally written on 16th July 2025 and PSDI outputs and the CDIF handbook accessed on that date - references for urls are annotated with a footnote which indicates their last accessed date. Both PSDI and CDIF are under development, so it will be updated over time. 

## _Checklist to implement_ review
This is the results of our review of the recommendations outlined in the [CDIF checklist*](https://cross-domain-interoperability-framework.github.io/cdifbook/background/checklistForImplementation.html):
> 1. Review the CDIF content model requirements
   * __done__: basic implementation at [PSDI metadata*](https://metadata.psdi.ac.uk/) to enable discovery based on the information provided by the resource. Documentation at [PSDI metadata guidance*](https://guidance.psdi.ac.uk/docusaurus-pages/docs/category/psdi-metadata/)
> 2. Determine how to generate CDIF JSON-LD metadata records
   * __done__: metadata collection via Excel templates, processed and validated into jsonld text files via python script workflow 
> 3. Make the metadata records accessible on the web
   * __done__: as consolidated jsonld files for all resources at [PSDI metadata*](https://metadata.psdi.ac.uk/) and for individual resources embedded in script elements in their landing page's source (e.g. search for "CDIF" in the html body of [Collaborative Computational Project for NMR Crystallography (CCP-NC) Magres Database - Example PSDI resource page*](https://resources.psdi.ac.uk/data/7e871747-1bd3-4abf-8fe3-dc4ec55b3771))
> 4. Generate a sitemap and get it on your website
   * __in progress__: code to generate/update sitemap.xml is being trialled and will be pointed to from a robots.txt file at the top-level of PSDI
> 5. notify any metadata aggregators
   * __in progress__: to be implemented after above point

## _Design principles_ review
__done__: [Design principles*](https://cross-domain-interoperability-framework.github.io/cdifbook/background/principles.html) (also described in "6.1. Design Principals" on page 26 of the [CDIF v1 report pdf](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11236871)) outline general principles (rather than specific actions) that align with PSDI metadata design principals and that we will strive to comply with in PSDI on an ongoing basis. However, to highlight one of these points in particular for specific comment:
> [ Design principles > Mainstream](https://cross-domain-interoperability-framework.github.io/cdifbook/background/principles.html#mainstream) (also described in and in section "6.1.2.2. Mainstream (HTTP methods, Resource-oriented, API-driven architecture, dereferenceable identifiers, Alternate serialisations" on page 27 of the [CDIF v1 report pdf](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11236871))
   * __future development__: The metadata for PSDI version 1 was intended to be an easily implemented lightweight Minimum Viable Product demonstrator of top-level metadata, and as such its prinicpal storage format is jsonld and ttl files stored in github [PSDI metadata github repository](https://github.com/PSDI-UK/metadata), published via github pages (as suggested in a possibility in point 2 of [CDIF checklist*](https://cross-domain-interoperability-framework.github.io/cdifbook/background/checklistForImplementation.html) ). We are now looking at more comprehensive technology stack for storing, processing and publishing the metadata which will enable the above.

## _Technical expression of metadata_ review
Much of the [Technical expression of metadata](https://cross-domain-interoperability-framework.github.io/cdifbook/metadata/technicalexpressionmetadata.html) (also described in and section "6.2. Technical expression of metadata" on page 29 of the [CDIF v1 report pdf](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11236871)) gives general background knowledge rather than specific actions. Here we pull out specific points which relate to PSDI metadata implementation:
> [Technical expression of metadata > Metadata content*](https://cross-domain-interoperability-framework.github.io/cdifbook/metadata/technicalexpressionmetadata.html#metadata-content) (also described in section "6.2.3. Metadata content" on page 30 of the [CDIF v1 report pdf](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11236871)):
   * __done__: We are using [DCAT](https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat-3/) as the metadata specification for the [PSDI resource catalogue](https://metadata.psdi.ac.uk/psdi-dcat.jsonld) (CDIF Discovery profile) and [SKOS](https://www.w3.org/TR/skos-primer/) as the metadata specification for [PSDI vocabulary](https://metadata.psdi.ac.uk/psdi-voc.jsonld) (CDIF Controlled Vocabularies profiles)
> [Technical expression of metadata > Metadata profiles*](https://cross-domain-interoperability-framework.github.io/cdifbook/metadata/technicalexpressionmetadata.html#metadata-profiles) (also described in section "6.2.3.1. Metadata profiles" on page 31 of the [CDIF v1 report pdf](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11236871)):
   * __done__: We are using SHACL shapes for validation of the two profiles that we have implemented. For the DCAT resource catalogue we needed to develop our own PSDI-specific SHACL shape [PSDI SHACL for validating PSDI Resource Catalogue DCAT*](https://metadata.psdi.ac.uk/psdi-dcat-shacl.jsonld) for full testing of all the fields since we had extended DCAT with some additional resource fields, and resource types (tools and guidance) as defined in [PSDI DCAT extension*](https://metadata.psdi.ac.uk/psdi-dcat-ext.jsonld). For the SKOS vocabulary we validate using SHACL shapes developed by others (see [PSDI Vocabulary Description > Validation](https://guidance.psdi.ac.uk/docusaurus-pages/docs/guidance/metadata/psdi-metadata/psdi-vocabulary-guidelines#validation) for details).
> [Queryable distribution interfaces (API)*](https://cross-domain-interoperability-framework.github.io/cdifbook/metadata/distributionapis.html) (also described in section "6.3.2. Queryable distribution interfaces (API)" on page 41 of the [CDIF v1 report pdf](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11236871)) and [Queryable distributions*](https://cross-domain-interoperability-framework.github.io/cdifbook/metadata/queryabledistributions.html) (also described in section "6.3.2.2. Data distribution (Data Provider conventions)" on page 43 of the [CDIF v1 report pdf](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11236871)):
   * __future development__ : We do not have an API for accessing PSDI data or metadata yet, but we will consult these recommendations when we do. 
> [Publishing metadata*](https://cross-domain-interoperability-framework.github.io/cdifbook/metadata/publishingmetadata.html) (also described in section "6.3.3. Publishing metadata" on page 46 of the [CDIF v1 report pdf](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11236871))
   * __done__ : we have published metadata:
      * aggregated into a jsonld and ttl file for each PSDI profile available at [PSDI metadata*](https://metadata.psdi.ac.uk/) as in Approach 1 in this page
      * the DCAT description for each individual resource is extracted from this overall DCAT file (at [PSDI Resource Catalogue](https://metadata.psdi.ac.uk/psdi-dcat.jsonld)) and embedded in their landing page source in script elements (e.g. search for "CDIF" in the html body for [Collaborative Computational Project for NMR Crystallography (CCP-NC) Magres Database - Example PSDI resource page*](https://resources.psdi.ac.uk/data/7e871747-1bd3-4abf-8fe3-dc4ec55b3771)). These resource catalogue landing pages are generated using the [React framework](https://nextjs.org/) and their metadata is embedded into them using that framework.
      * _questions for CDIF experts_: 
         * [Q1] Do you recommend that we produce a "FDO PID Kernel information record" referred to in [Publishing metadata > Signposting](https://cross-domain-interoperability-framework.github.io/cdifbook/metadata/publishingmetadata.html#signposting) and on page 32 of the [CDIF v1 report pdf](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11236871) - I wasn't quite clear on this. Or can we use approach 3 instead of approach 1 but link to a particular part of the PSDI Resource Catalogue e.g. http://metadata.psdi.ac.uk/psdi-dcat/data/7e871747-1bd3-4abf-8fe3-dc4ec55b3771 (when we make these urls resolvable within [http://metadata.psdi.ac.uk/psdi-dcat](http://metadata.psdi.ac.uk/psdi-dcat)) instead of linking to this "FDO PID Kernel information record"?
         * [Q2] As mentioned, we are generating the resource catalogue landing pages using the [React framework](https://nextjs.org/), but could not embed the metadata into the \<head\> element of the pages using that, so had to put it into the \<body\> element. There are 3 places where your documentation seems to point to advocate putting it into the \<head\> element: 
            1. [Mapping from Signposting relations to CDIF metadata elements](https://cross-domain-interoperability-framework.github.io/cdifbook/metadata/signpostinglinkrel.html) : "The Signposting approach embeds links in HTML pages or in the HTTP header that is included in the response to HTTP GET or HEAD requests."
            2. [Metadata publication > Option 1. Embedded in HTML](https://cross-domain-interoperability-framework.github.io/cdifbook/metadata/publication.html#option-1-embedded-in-html) : ..."if there are HTML landing pages that describe the resources of interest, and the metadata publisher has the necessary authority to update the content of these pages, then CDIF metadata serialised as JSON-LD (see Appendix 1) should be embedded in an HTML \<script\> element in the \<head\> section of each landing page 3"...
            3. [Publishing metadata > Search Engines](https://cross-domain-interoperability-framework.github.io/cdifbook/metadata/publishingmetadata.html#search-engines) : See "Search Engines" > bullet point 4 "The server providing the resource can be configured to include"...
            * points 2 and 3 above specifically recommend adding the metadata to the page \<head\> but point 1 seems to suggest that it is OK to put it into the page \<body\>. If it is OK then maybe you could adjust the CDIF documentation to say that the \<head\> is OK if it's not possible to put it into the \<body\>? If it's not OK then let us know and we will need to revisit this on our side.
   * __in progress__: code to generate/update sitemap.xml is being trialled and will be pointed to from a robots.txt file at the top-level of PSDI
      * _questions for CDIF experts_: 
         * [Q3] sitemap.xml will list: https://metadata.psdi.ac.uk/ ; https://metadata.psdi.ac.uk/psdi-dcat.jsonld, and also resource landing pages for the individual resources which contain the metadata in them as described above. Will this be sufficient for the harvesters to find and use the metadata?

## _1. Discovery_ review
> [Metadata Recommendations*](https://cross-domain-interoperability-framework.github.io/cdifbook/metadata/recommendations.html) (also described in section "6.3. Discovery" on page 37 of the [CDIF v1 report pdf](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11236871)):
* [Content model](https://cross-domain-interoperability-framework.github.io/cdifbook/metadata/contentmodel.html) (also described in [Metadata Recommendations*](https://cross-domain-interoperability-framework.github.io/cdifbook/metadata/recommendations.html))
   * __done__: Note that we have implemented the PSDI resource catalogue metadata content as [DCAT](https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat-3/), rather than [Schema.org](http://schema.org/) because of close historical links between DCAT creators and STFC. The [PSDI resource catalogue](https://metadata.psdi.ac.uk/psdi-dcat.jsonld) is published as a standalone metadata file, with top-level object of type dcat:Catalog which contains details of all [resources](https://guidance.psdi.ac.uk/docusaurus-pages/docs/guidance/metadata/psdi-metadata/psdi-terminology#resource) which are made available via PSDI (of type dcat:Dataset for [data](https://guidance.psdi.ac.uk/docusaurus-pages/docs/guidance/metadata/psdi-metadata/psdi-terminology#data), dcat:DataService for [service](https://guidance.psdi.ac.uk/docusaurus-pages/docs/guidance/metadata/psdi-metadata/psdi-terminology#service), psdiDcatExt:Tool for [tool](https://guidance.psdi.ac.uk/docusaurus-pages/docs/guidance/metadata/psdi-metadata/psdi-terminology#tool) or psdiDcatExt:Guidance for [guidance](https://guidance.psdi.ac.uk/docusaurus-pages/docs/guidance/metadata/psdi-metadata/psdi-terminology#guidance)), which are either grouped into nested dcat:Catalog objects which represent [resource themes](https://guidance.psdi.ac.uk/docusaurus-pages/docs/guidance/metadata/psdi-metadata/psdi-terminology#resource-theme) where appropriate, or otherwise are top-level core PSDI resources. Note that while dcat:Catalog, dcat:Dataset and dcat:DataService are DCAT resource types, psdiDcatExt:Tool and dcatExt:Guidance are extension points for the dcat:Resource class which we have defined in [psdi-dcat-ext.jsonld](https://metadata.psdi.ac.uk/psdi-dcat-ext.jsonld). Documentation for this is available at: [PSDI Resource Catalogue Description](https://guidance.psdi.ac.uk/docusaurus-pages/docs/guidance/metadata/psdi-metadata/psdi-resource-catalogue-guidelines/). Landing pages for resources made available via PSDI have the relevant portion of this metadata that describes that resource embedded in the page source in script elements (e.g. search for "CDIF" in the html body for [Collaborative Computational Project for NMR Crystallography (CCP-NC) Magres Database - Example PSDI resource page*](https://resources.psdi.ac.uk/data/7e871747-1bd3-4abf-8fe3-dc4ec55b3771))).  
* JSON-LD serialization
   * __done__: PSDI have implemented a JSON-LD serialization for that content using the DCAT rdf vocabulary to define the fields in a metadata record ([psdi-dcat.jsonld](https://metadata.psdi.ac.uk/psdi-dcat.jsonld)) but not Schema.org (and do not have plans to implement it in that format)
* Workflows to publish CDIF metadata (as described in [Metadata publication](https://cross-domain-interoperability-framework.github.io/cdifbook/metadata/publication.html)):
   * __in progress__: PSDI have implemented [Option 1. Embedded in HTML](https://cross-domain-interoperability-framework.github.io/cdifbook/metadata/publication.html#option-1-embedded-in-html) (and also [Option 2. Individual metadata file URLs](https://cross-domain-interoperability-framework.github.io/cdifbook/metadata/publication.html#option-2-individual-metadata-file-urls) but have not been able to link these to the resource pages). Our release of a sitemap.xml is in progress and the release of a robots.txt file will follow that.
   * _questions for CDIF experts_: 
      * [Q4] PSDI have implemented [Option 1. Embedded in HTML](https://cross-domain-interoperability-framework.github.io/cdifbook/metadata/publication.html#option-1-embedded-in-html) although we would have preferred the other options (to minimise the duplication of metadata). We couldn't get [Option 2. Individual metadata file URLs](https://cross-domain-interoperability-framework.github.io/cdifbook/metadata/publication.html#option-2-individual-metadata-file-urls) working because it seems non-trivial to link jsonld data from another page into the \<head\>\<script\> of a webpage - see [internet thread aboout linking external json ld schema](https://webmasters.stackexchange.com/questions/104024/linking-external-json-ld-schema-from-schema-org). I'm not sure that [Option 3. Metadata list file](https://cross-domain-interoperability-framework.github.io/cdifbook/metadata/publication.html#option-3-metadata-list-file) works with DCAT since Appendix 1 > A1.3. Examples > Example 3 seems to be reliant on the schema.org "about" field to link this metadata to the resource that it describes. However, there doesn't seem to be a good DCAT direct mapping for this field - the DCAT-schema.org mappings (page 5) suggested mapping this field onto dcat:theme which we use to capture the scientific discipline of the resource. If we could get [Option 2. Individual metadata file URLs](https://cross-domain-interoperability-framework.github.io/cdifbook/metadata/publication.html#option-2-individual-metadata-file-urls) working and point to a part of [psdi-dcat.jsonld](https://metadata.psdi.ac.uk/psdi-dcat.jsonld) that would be our preference long-term.

> [Basic discovery metadata content model*](https://cross-domain-interoperability-framework.github.io/cdifbook/metadata/contentmodel.html) (also described in section "6.3.1. Metadata content requirements" on page 37 of the [CDIF v1 report pdf](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11236871)):
   * __done__: The following elements are included in our PSDI DCAT resource catalogue:

### Required elements:
| CDIF element | PSDI DCAT element | SHACL shape in [psdi-dcat-shacl.jsonld](https://metadata.psdi.ac.uk/psdi-dcat-shacl.jsonld) | Further Comment |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Resource identifier | dcterms:identifier | psdiDcatShacl:IdentifierPropertyShape | __done__ |
| Title | dcterms:title |  psdiDcatShacl:TitlePropertyShape | __done__ |
| Distribution | dcat:Dataset > dcat:Distribution > dcat:downloadURL, dcat:accessURL or dcat:accessService as appropriate; dcat:DataService > dcat:endpointURL; psdiDcatExt:Tool > psdiDcatExt:downloadURL; psdiDcatExt:Guidance > dcat:landingPage |  psdiDcatShacl:DistributionPropertyShape; psdiDcatShacl:DownloadURLPropertyShape; psdiDcatShacl:AccessURLPropertyShape; psdiDcatShacl:AccessServicePropertyShape; psdiDcatShacl:EndPointUrlPropertyShape; psdiDcatShacl:DcatExtDownloadURLPropertyShape; psdiDcatShacl:LandingPagePropertyShape | __done__: elements for capturing URLs depends on resource types, as shown. DCAT does not have the concept of distributions for DataServices - we would just add a separate DataService for another service that was accessed via a different endpointURL. We might add distributions to our DCAT tools extension point in a future version (for now a multiple tools are added for different formats of the same tool). __future development__: Most of these URLS for accessing resources are not formal APIs, and most do not have descriptions of how to use them - this is something that we could address in time. |
| Rights | dcterms:accessRights and dcterms:license |  psdiDcatShacl:AccessRightsPropertyShape and psdiDcatShacl:LicensePropertyShape | __future development__ : dcterms:accessRights is a much simpler access rights implementation than suggested by CDIF, and is a temporary placeholder - see section [2. Data access](#2-data-access-review) below for more details |
| Metadata profile identifier | dcterms:conformsTo |  psdiDcatShacl:ConformsToPropertyShape | __done__: Note that this element belongs to the dcat:Catalog top level of [psdi-dcat.jsonld](https://metadata.psdi.ac.uk/psdi-dcat.jsonld) to indicate that it applies to the whole resource catalogue metadata. It is set to "dcterms:conformsTo": { "@id": "https://cross-domain-interoperability-framework.github.io/cdifbook/metadata/discovery.html", "rdfs:label": "CDIF_core_discovery_1.0", "@type": "dcterms:Standard"} |
| Resource type | dcterms:type |  psdiDcatShacl:DCTypePropertyShape | __done__: resources in PSDI catalogue have values: dcmitype:Collection for dcat:Catalog; dcmitype:Dataset for dcat:Dataset; dcmitype:Service for dcat:DataService; dcmitype:Software for psdiDcatExt:Tool and dcmitype:Text for psdiDcatExt:Guidance |

   * _questions for CDIF experts_: 
      * [Q5] Is the form of this dcterms:conformsTo right? The examples in Appendix 1 e.g. example 1 p125, example 2 p126 and example 3 p127 have rather free-form values for this field. e.g. "dct:conformsTo": "ex:cdif-metadataSpec". Example 3 on page 27 includes 3 instances of this, the last 2 of which uses the abbreviation dct (which incidentally has not been declared in the context).

### Conditional elements:

   * _questions for CDIF experts_: 
      * [Q6] I may need to think more about the distinction between metadata elements and those for the resources e.g. have I correctly implemented "Resource identifier" and "Metadata Identifier". When I compare our schema with "Example 2" in [Schema.org implementation of CDIF metadata](https://cross-domain-interoperability-framework.github.io/cdifbook/metadata/schemaorgimplementation.html) I see the following differences:
         * my Digitial Document metadata is all at the dcat:Catalog top level for the overarching document - similar to your ex:URIforNode1 element in Example 1. I hope this is OK even though it's not as granular as being down to the resource level. I am thinking that I should change the type of this top level so that it's something like Digital Document and not dcat:Catalog which is the same as the descriptions of the resource themes within it.
         * all the dcat:Catalog, dcat:Dataset, dcat:DataService, psdiDcatExt:Tool and psdiDcatExt:Guidance elements within it hold the metadata describing the resources - similar to your ex:URIforNode1 element in Example 2. I am thinking that I should change the dcterms:identifier values to point to identifiers for the resources e.g. https://resources.psdi.ac.uk/data/7e871747-1bd3-4abf-8fe3-dc4ec55b3771 and leave the @id to be the identifier for the metadata e.g. psdiDcat:data/7e871747-1bd3-4abf-8fe3-dc4ec55b3771, which expands to http://metadata.psdi.ac.uk/psdi-dcat/data/7e871747-1bd3-4abf-8fe3-dc4ec55b3771
      * The snippet of the resource catalogue which is embedded in the resource pages is only the metadata describing the resource and not the top-level dcat:CatalogDigitial Document metadata so we might need to add to this (if we keep the metadata in the resource pages rather than finding a way to point to it in psdi-dcat.jsonld)...

## _2. Data access_ review
> [Data Access Introduction*](https://cross-domain-interoperability-framework.github.io/cdifbook/data_access/intro.html) (also described in section "6.4. Data Access" on page 50 of the [CDIF v1 report pdf](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11236871))
* __future development__: PSDI investigated the use of [Open Digital Rights Language (ODRL)](https://www.w3.org/TR/odrl-model/) to define access policies for resources in the PSDI resource catalogue but did not implement it for PSDI version 1 since it was quite complex, and access policies in PSDI have not yet been defined to the level of detail required to implement this.  As an interim solution, PSDI define dcterms:accessRights of the resource themes and resources in the [PSDI resource catalogue](https://metadata.psdi.ac.uk/psdi-dcat.jsonld) by assigning each with a value from the [Controlled Vocabularies for Repositories (COAR) access rights vocabulary v1.1](https://vocabularies.coar-repositories.org/access_rights/). This implementation is much simpler and higher level - it defines only 4 very top-level access levels:
   * [embargoed access](https://vocabularies.coar-repositories.org/access_rights/c_f1cf/)
   * [metadata only access](https://vocabularies.coar-repositories.org/access_rights/c_14cb/)
   * [open access](https://vocabularies.coar-repositories.org/access_rights/c_abf2/)
   * [restricted access](https://vocabularies.coar-repositories.org/access_rights/c_16ec/)

We recognise that this is not an ideal and long-term solution (it is not a machine-actionable access policies) and will revisit the use of ODRL as PSDI matures.

## _3. Controlled vocabularies_ review
> [Controlled Vocabularies*](https://cross-domain-interoperability-framework.github.io/cdifbook/controlled_vocabularies/vocabintro.html) (also described in section "6.5. Controlled vocabularies" on page 70 of the [CDIF v1 report pdf](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11236871)):
   * __done__: prior to discovering CDIF, we had identified the need for consistent terminology as a top priority for PSDI. For PSDI version 1 the [SKOS](https://www.w3.org/TR/skos-primer/) vocabulary which defines top-level PSDI outputs, is published at [PSDI vocabulary](https://metadata.psdi.ac.uk/psdi-voc.jsonld), documented at [PSDI Vocabulary Description](https://guidance.psdi.ac.uk/docusaurus-pages/docs/guidance/metadata/psdi-metadata/psdi-vocabulary-guidelines/) and also processed into a more human-readable form at [PSDI Terminology](https://guidance.psdi.ac.uk/docusaurus-pages/docs/guidance/metadata/psdi-metadata/psdi-terminology). In the future, we will grow this terminology to further collections as needed (for example, possibly for property mapping, and field value enumeration and definition). The terms have permanent ids expressed as their @id values.
      * Implementation of [Cox et al. (2021) "Ten Simple Rules for making a Vocabulary FAIR"](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1009041):
         * Rule 1. Determine the governance arrangements and custodian of the legacy vocabulary:
            * __done__: there is a dcterms:creator field for [PSDI vocabulary](https://metadata.psdi.ac.uk/psdi-voc.jsonld)
         * Rule 2. Verify that the legacy-vocabulary license allows repurposing, and agree on the license for the FAIR vocabulary: 
            * __done__: There is a dcterms:license field for [PSDI vocabulary](https://metadata.psdi.ac.uk/psdi-voc.jsonld). This is not based on a legacy vocabulary so the part that relates to tha is not applicable here.
         * Rule 3. Check term and definition completeness and consistency in the legacy vocabulary:
            * __done__: each term concept defined has a rdfs:label and skos:definition. Where possible we tried to define the type which each term was describing eithre as a rdf:type, or if not possible then as using definitions from the Oxford English Dictionary quoted in the definition. The terms were subject to review from a metadata working group from representatvies across the PSDI core team, partners, and version 1 contributors, listed in dcterms:contributor.
          * Rule 4. Establish a traceable maintenance-environment for the FAIR vocabulary content:
            * __done__: the SKOS vocabulary is available as [psdi-voc.jsonld](https://metadata.psdi.ac.uk/psdi-voc.jsonld) and [psdi-voc.ttl](https://metadata.psdi.ac.uk/psdi-voc.ttl) and both are held with the rest of the PSDI metadata in the [PSDI Metadata github repository](https://github.com/PSDI-UK/metadata) which retains previous versions and handles its version control. 
          * Rule 5. Assign a unique and persistent identifier to (a) the vocabulary and (b) each term in the vocabulary:
            * __done__: The pid for the vocabulary is psdiVoc:vocabulary which expands to http://metadata.psdi.ac.uk/psdi-voc#vocabulary and that of the terms is e.g. psdiVoc:pathfinder which expands to http://metadata.psdi.ac.uk/psdi-voc#pathfinder. There is more discussion of ids at [General Guidelines for PSDI Metadata > PIDs (Persistent Identifiers)](https://guidance.psdi.ac.uk/docusaurus-pages/docusaurus-pages/docs/guidance/metadata/psdi-metadata/psdi-general-guidelines#pids-persistent-identifiers) and specific to the PSDI vocabulary at [PSDI Vocabulary Description > Top-level vocabulary metadata fields](https://guidance.psdi.ac.uk/docusaurus-pages/docs/guidance/metadata/psdi-metadata/psdi-vocabulary-guidelines#Top-level-vocabulary-metadata-fields).
            * _Note to CDIF experts_: I think the persistent ID of the vocabulary needs changing to http://metadata.psdi.ac.uk/psdi-voc now that I look at it again. I will change this when I make other changes as part of the updates after your feedback.
          * Rule 6. Create machine readable representations of the vocabulary terms: 
            * __done__: we use rdf:type, skos:broader, skos:narrower, skos:related, skos:topConceptOf and skos:Collection elements to confer extra context to concepts defined. While we did not use any of the suggested technologies for data entry (we just edited by hand using Visual Studio Code), we did use [qSKOS](https://qskos.poolparty.biz/) for validation after edits, and other SKOS-specific validation (as documented in [PSDI Vocabulary Description > Validation](https://guidance.psdi.ac.uk/docusaurus-pages/docs/guidance/metadata/psdi-metadata/psdi-vocabulary-guidelines#validation)) and other non-SKOS-specific validation (as documented in [PSDI Metadata Checking Guidelines](https://guidance.psdi.ac.uk/docusaurus-pages/docs/guidance/metadata/psdi-metadata/psdi-checking-guidelines))
          * Rule 7. Add vocabulary metadata: 
            * __done__: vocabulary metadata is captured at the top level for the vocabulary in fields dcterms:title, rdfs:label, dcterms:description, dc11:Version, dcterms:conformsTo, dcterms:created, dcterms:modified, dcterms:creator, dcterms:contributor, dcterms:publisher, dcterms:license, foaf:fundedBy, dc11:subject
            * _Question for CDIF experts_: 
               * [Q7] I have set the "dcterms:conformsTo" value to "CDIF_core_controlled_vocabulary_1.0" - all good (this may relate to [Q5])?
          * Rule 8. Register the vocabulary: 
            * __future development__: we have not done any of this yet because the vocabulary is very focussed to PSDI applications. As this vocabulary grows to be of more general community interest we will revisit this.
          * Rule 9. Make the vocabulary accessible for humans and machines: 
            * __future development__: As discussed in the [_Design principles_ review](#design-principles-review) section above, our simple first publication of metadata for PSDI version 1 did not allow for resolvable terms or HTTP content negotiation. The technology stack that we are investigating for the future will allow for this, and implement a SPARQL endpoint, and API. 
          * Rule 10. Implement a process for publishing revisions of the FAIR vocabulary: 
            * __done__: because we are at version 1 of PSDI we have not had to revise the vocabulary or its terms yet, but will use the dcterms:modified, dcterms:isReplacedBy, dcterms:replaces, owl:deprecated, owl:versionInfo, skos:changeNote and skos:historyNote fields, and follow the rest of this guidance as and when we do.
      * [CDIF SKOS profile](https://cross-domain-interoperability-framework.github.io/cdifbook/controlled_vocabularies/cdifskosprofile.html) (also see section "6.5.3. Using SKOS" on page 72 of the [CDIF v1 report pdf](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11236871))
         * __future development__: this is not relevant yet but probably will be soon, so we will implement this when we do need to enumerate PSDI-wide categorical variables
      * [Statistical Classification](https://cross-domain-interoperability-framework.github.io/cdifbook/controlled_vocabularies/statisticalclassification.html#statistical-classification)  (also see CDIF SKOS profile "6.5.4. Formal statistical classifications"):
         * __future development__: not relevant yet but we will bear it in mind if we do need to define this kind of metadata

## _4. Data integration_ review

[PSDI Cross Data Search](https://data-search.psdi.ac.uk/) enables basic searches across the data resources that it makes available. It is a first version demonstrator of how this kind of search might work and uses (OPTIMADE)[https://www.optimade.org/] as the engine and common language behind the search. Currently most of the searchable properties in PSDI Cross Data Search are core OPTIMADE fields for the [structures](https://schemas.optimade.org/defs/v1.2/entrytypes/optimade/structures) and [references](https://schemas.optimade.org/defs/v1.2/entrytypes/optimade/references) entrytypes which define the fields for those end points as agreed by the [OPTIMADE community](https://www.optimade.org/contributors). There are however some custom properties that do not correspond to these fields, that are searchable in the PSDI Cross Data Search, and there will be more in the future. In the first instance we intend to define these properties in a [OPTIMADE PSDI namespace](https://www.optimade.org/providers-dashboard/providers/psdi.html) or work with the developers of the [OPTIMADE cheminformatics namespace](https://github.com/Materials-Consortia/namespace-cheminformatics) for properties that are more appropriate to be defined there. It is therefore relatively straightforward for a potential contributor to PSDI to "plug into" the PSDI Cross Data Search by becoming an [OPTIMADE database provider](https://github.com/Materials-Consortia/providers?tab=readme-ov-file) and realising an OPTIMADE API to serve data from one or more databases. There is also a secondary route to "plug into" the PSDI Cross Data Search whereby data sources are indexed via a backend PSDI indexing service.

As such, using [OPTIMADE](https://www.optimade.org/) as the basis of our Data integration in the first instance has been beneficial for PSDI for a number of reasons:
* providing the initial common property definitions 
* providing a mechanism and framework for adding new property definitions
* providing the common query language for retrieving data from sources agnostic of their native data format - it's up to each provider how they retrieve the data before it is delivered in this common format
* providing a basic framework for unit definition of properties which is linked into the search

This is a different approach to that suggested by CDIF and described in [Data Integration](https://cross-domain-interoperability-framework.github.io/cdifbook/data_integration/dataintegrationintro.html) (and section "6.6. Data integration" of on page 74 of the [CDIF v1 report pdf](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11236871)). We took this different approach for the reasons above and also because initially we had no data sources which had the format of simple csv files - they were all in more complex data formats and databases. However, we class this section of CDIF recommendations as __future development__ rather than __not planned__ because in the future it may be useful to supplement our OPTIMADE data intgration with one based on CDIF recommendations (e.g. mapping them together so that [DDI-CDI](https://ddialliance.org/Specification/ddi-cdi) feeds into our OPTIMADE implementation) for two reasons:
* Many physical sciences researchers will produce their output as csv files so that a mechanism to describe and query csv files without needing to index and duplicate data is an elegant solution which removes data redundancy
* as CDIF and [DDI-CDI](https://ddialliance.org/Specification/ddi-cdi) develops beyond simple csv files, it will become more relevant to describe more PSDI data

## _5. Universals_ review
PSDI version 1 did not require the definition of Universals as described in [Universals: Time, Geography, and Units of Measurement](https://cross-domain-interoperability-framework.github.io/cdifbook/universals/univintro.html) and section "6.7. Universals: Time, Geography, and Units of Measurement" on page 97 of the [CDIF v1 report pdf](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11236871).
However, this seems like a sensible ways to structure top-level universals for profiles that support search of PSDI either at a resource or data level.

As such, reviewing the initial CDIF-suggested universal profiles:
* [Geography](https://cross-domain-interoperability-framework.github.io/cdifbook/universals/univgeography.html) (also see section "6.7.2. Geography" on page 98 of the [CDIF v1 report pdf](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11236871)):
   * __not planned__: this has not been relevant in PSDI resources or data to date, but we will revisit if it is important going forward
* [Time](https://cross-domain-interoperability-framework.github.io/cdifbook/universals/univtime.html) (also see section "6.7.3. Time" on page 102 of the [CDIF v1 report pdf](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11236871)):
   * __not planned__: We do not plan to capture Time in a separate PSDI metadata profile at this point, unless it becomes relevant in new PSDI resources. However, where we capture times in other PSDI metadata profiles e.g. in dcterms:issued or dcterms:modified of resources in [PSDI Resource Catalogue](https://metadata.psdi.ac.uk/psdi-dcat.jsonld), these have "@type": "xsd:dateTime" and values according to [ISO8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601).
* [Units of measurement](https://cross-domain-interoperability-framework.github.io/cdifbook/universals/univuom.html) (also see section "6.7.4. Units of measurement" on page 104 of the [CDIF v1 report pdf](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11236871))
   * __future development__: As discussed in section [4. _Data Integration Review](#4-data-integration-review) above the PSDI Cross Data Search uses [OPTIMADE](https://www.optimade.org/) behind the scenes and this uses its own units definition as described in [OPTIMADE unitsystem](https://schemas.optimade.org/defs/v1.2/unitsystems/optimade/optimade.html). This only partially addresses PSDI requirements for Unit definition and conversion though, so we will evaluate the various unit systems outlined by CDIF (and also [M-Layer](M-Layer)) against those requirements as a first step before implementing a Units Universal profile for PSDI which maps onto OPTIMADE units as required. 

## Final points
CDIF has made a real difference to guide and frame the first version of PSDI metadata and has accelerated our progress by recommending best practices and summarising choices to be made along the way. It has given us an achievable first scope for PSDI metadata version 1 but will also allow us to grow this over time as PSDI and CDIF develop beyond version 1. It was reassuring how well it aligned with PSDI initial plans - we had already, independently decided to start at the top-level with a SKOS vocabulary and DCAT catalogue description. CDIF has been an invaluable starting point for our initial metadata implementation, and we intend to continue applying CDIF v1 recommendations that we have marked as __in progress__ and __future development__ and to use future CDIF outputs as a starting point for future developments. 

* _questions for CDIF experts_:
   * [Q8] Is referring to both the pdf and the web handbook versions of CDIF making this a little unwiedly? Do you think its worth restricting reference points to one or that other, and if so which would you choose?
   * [Q9] Just a minor feedback point, that I thought I would pass onto you (although I suspect it's too late to do anything about at this point) - on page 32 it refers to "(FDOFIdentificationRecord in Figure 1, above)". I think this should be "Figure 2, below" but it's actually called "FDOIdentifierRecord" in there...
