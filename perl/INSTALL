Do these steps at the command line:

   perl Build.PL
   ./Build
   ./Build test
   sudo ./Build install

If you are on a system that uses root, you should become root before
doing the last step, then simply type

  ./Build install

The first step will warn you if you have any missing dependencies.  If
you are, doing 

   sudo ./Build installdeps

should build and install everythinig that is needed.
