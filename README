			 XAS Data Interchange
                       ========================

This README file explains the XAS Data Interchange (XDI) distribution.
The XDI distribution contains the specification documents and various
implementations of a formal, grammer-based system for reading and
writing files containing single-scan XAS data.

The specification is contained in the grammer file (called `grammer'
and contained in the root folder of this distribution).  In that file,
the file specification is defined as an augmeted Backus-Naur Form
(BNF) grammer.  This grammer can be used by any aBNF-aware tool to
parse the contents of an XDI-compliant file.

Full documentation of the XDI specification is contained in the
specification document, which is written using LaTeX and contained in
the `latex/' folder.  This LaTeX file depends on things that should be
contained in any recent latex installation.  It can be compiled to a
PDF file by entering the `latex/' folder and issuing this
commmand twice: "pdflatex xdi.tex".  This will produce a file called
`xdi.pdf' which can be viewed by any PDF viewer.
